Source code for Build Settings mod.

# What does this mod do?
This mod is meant to port forward features from [Cucumber's Build Upgrade](https://github.com/cucumber-sp/SFSBuildUpgrade) that are missing from his new Part Editor mod, and also add more stuff on top such as things from [Infinity's RandomTweaks](https://github.com/4JX/RandomTweaks/tree/main/RandomTweaks).

Current features are:
- Toggles for part snapping and adaptation
- Grid snap interval changer
- Rotation amount changer

This is a very early version of the mod, and more will be released very soon. Stay tuned.
